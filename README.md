> [!CAUTION]
> This project has been deprecated in favor of the native Kubernetes [VolumeAttributesClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/) API.
> No new features will be added. Security and bug fixes will still be released until at least 6 months after Kubernetes v1.34 is GA (*approximately Q1 2026, exact date is subject to change*). See [[Deprecation Announcement] volume-modifier-for-k8s](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/issues/2435) for more information.

`volume-modifier-for-k8s` is a sidecar deployed alongside CSI drivers to enable volume modification through annotations on the PVC.

## Requirements

Leader election must be enabled in the [external-resizer](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-resizer). This is required in order to efficiently coordinate calls to the EC2 modify-volume API.
